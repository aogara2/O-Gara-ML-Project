In this project, the focus is on a UCI HAR dataset, which contains sensor data from accelerometers
and gyroscopes embedded in smartphones worn by 30 participants. These participants performed six
predefined activities: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying.
The dataset captures time-series data with 561 features extracted from raw sensor signals, including
statistical and frequency domain features.

The objective is to develop machine learning models to classify these activities with high accuracy
and efficiency. Both traditional machine learning approaches, such as Logistic Regres-
sion, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines (SVM), and advanced methods like Convolu-
tional Neural Networks (CNN) and XGBoost are explored. The inputs to the models are the extracted feature
vectors from the UCI HAR dataset, while the outputs are the predicted activity classes. The prob-
lemâ€™s complexity arises from the similarities between certain activities, such as walking and walking
upstairs, which necessitate sophisticated feature extraction and classification methods.
